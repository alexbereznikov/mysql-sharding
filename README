mysql-sharding - mysql database plugin adding the possibility of sharding the database

Quickstart guide

1. Requirements

To compile plugin you need:
 - mysql 5.5.x source code
 - GNU Make
 - GCC
 - CMake
 - hiredis library (https://github.com/antirez/hiredis)

2. Compilation on *nix systems

First, you need to unpack mysql source code. Then unpack plugin source to 'storage'
directory of mysql source. Now source is ready to compile.

Use cmake for configuring and generating makefiles, for example:
  mysql-source$ mkdir ../mysql-build && cd ../mysql-build
  mysql-build$ cmake ../mysql-source

After all, simply type make:
  mysql-build$ make

Plugin object file will be located at storage/sharding subdirectory of mysql build directory.

3. Installation

You need to copy plugin object file to your mysql plugins directory, usually 
/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin. Then you have to install plugin - run mysql client:

  ~/$ mysql -u root -p
	
At mysql prompt you would type something like this:

  > INSTALL PLUGIN sharding SONAME 'ha_sharding.so'

This will install plugin permanently. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/install-plugin.html for reference.
